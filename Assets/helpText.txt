General User Information:

To Place a Gate, first click on the type of Gate you want to add, and
then on an empty tile on the board. By clicking on further empty tiles you
can continue to place Gates of this type until you deselect it (by clicking the type)
or select another type.

To remove a Gate, place an empty tile at its position.

To connect two Gates, click on one of their in-/outputs, and drag a line to the out-/input of the other Gate.
Note: You can only connect Outputs to Inputs (and vice-versa), and Gates cannot be connected if this
connection would constitute a loop.

You can Undo any board action by clicking on the Edit -> Undo-Button or by CTRL-Z, and Redo undone actions
by clicking on the Edit -> Redo-Button or by CTRL-Y.

To evaluate a circuit, click on Edit -> Evaluate or CTRL-E

To clear the board (Remove everything), click on Edit -> Reset Board or CTRL-R

You can save any board in a file and load saved boards.
To do so, select File -> Save or File -> Load or alternatively CTRL-S or CTRL-O


A note about scrolling: 
When placing a gate on the border of the current board,
the board will extend by one row or column or both, but the scroll bars
will only adjust if the user actively scrolls afterwards => If you are all
the way scrolled down and place a tile in the lowest row you have to scroll
up a tiny bit before you can scroll down to the new tile. Alternatively,
you can just not scroll down fully before placing the new gate.
Same for columns.

A note about placing gates:
You must not move your mouse between clicking and releasing the mouse button,
because otherwise this will be interpreted as mouse drag and an
attempt to draw a connection between gates.
