Help, Eclipse keeps deleting my folder ...

A note about scrolling: When placing a 
gate on the border of the current board,
the board will extend by one row or 
column or both, but the scroll bars
will only adjust if the user actively
scrolls afterwards => If you are all
the way scrolled down and place a tile
in the lowest row you have to scroll
up a tiny bit before you can scroll 
down to the new tile. Alternatively,
you can just not scroll down fully
before placing the new gate.
Same for columns.

A note about placing gates:
You must not move your mouse between
clicking and releasing the mouse button,
because otherwise this will be 
interpreted as mouse drag and an
attempt to draw a connection 
between gates.
