by Dominik Baumann, Philipp Grzywaczyk, Cameron McGregor

Final Project for Practical Software Technology 2022

This program enables the user to build a logical circuit from scratch by using the standard
gates, these are: NOT, AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR; as well as constant TRUE and FALSE inputs, 
and by connecting these via cables.
The resulting circuits can be evaluated with regard to their truth value at each position.
For further information on how to use the program, please consult "Help".
